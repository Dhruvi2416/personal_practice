There are 2 types of elements 
Inline and block
Inline:
They are inside the block level elements. there width is based on how much the individual element needs.
You can't add addition styiling to it. If you want add inline-block.
Ex. img, a, span, strong, b, em, i, code, input and button.

Block:
They takes entire width to be occupied. Always have a line before and after the element.
Ex. div, p, h1, h6, form, ol,ul,li,figure,article,section,footer etc.



What is an HTML Attribute ?
It modifies the HTML elements. Control the behaviour of HTML elements. Every tag has two sections first one is name
of attribute and another one is it's value.  Attributes are inside the start tag of that element which needs to be changed.
Attributes can be 

<img src="link" width="20px" height="20px" alt="imgs">
src, width,height,alt are attributes.
< a href="link">
href=link // name:value pair
<p style ="color:red"></p>

you can use any quotes single or double but when you want to specify something you can use single 
quotes in double quotes and double in single
For example:

src specifies path of the image to be displayed
href specifies link of the URL to be navigated to

title describes more info of the element while hovering on it
alt describes alternative of the image
