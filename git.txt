Git is a distributed version control System.
Version control system allows software developers to work together along with their histories of work being maintained.
It does not allow overwriting each other's changes and also maintains history of every version.
DCVS clients not only checks the latest changes but al;so maintains history of the repository. If server goes down then repo from any client can be copied back to the serverto restore it.
You can commit chamges, create new branch view logs and perform other operations even while remaining offline. 
The only time you require connection is while publishing your changes.


stash:
A place to hide modifications while you work on something else.
(ekle ke kaik ad dkaryu modify karyu ne commit karta pehela tamare kaik biju modify karvu pade em hoi to pehela
aa add files ke modified files ne stash kari lo ne pachi biji branch ma changes hoi ke kai bi biju)

      git stash push: Saves your local modifications in a new stash
	  git stash pop: Apllies the changes from the latest stash and then remove the stash
	  git stash apply: Apllies the changes to the workspace, by default it is the latest stash
	  git stash list: List the stashes that you have
	  git stash show [<stash>] :Show the changes recorded in the stash as a diff between the stashed state and original parent. When no <stash> is given
	                                       shows the latest one.
      git stash drop [<stash>] : Remove a single stash from the stash list. If no <stash> is given removes the latest stash.
	  git stash clear: Removes all stashed states. And might be is impossible to recover all changes.
	  git stash branch <branchname> [<stash>]: Creates and checks new branch named <branchname> starting from the commit at which <stash. was originally created,
	  applies changesrecorded to new working tree. With no any <stash> mentioned it will create a new stash and stashes all changes. This is heplful when git stash push has enough changes
	  done that agit staash apply gives merge conflicts. Since stash is applied on top of HEAD commit  at that time git stash wikll restore originally stashed state with no conflicts.
